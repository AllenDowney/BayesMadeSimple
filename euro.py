"""This file contains a partial solution to a problem from
MacKay, "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms."

    Exercise 3.15 (page 50): A statistical statement appeared in
    "The Guardian" on Friday January 4, 2002:

        When spun on edge 250 times, a Belgian one-euro coin came
        up heads 140 times and tails 110.  'It looks very suspicious
        to me,' said Barry Blight, a statistics lecturer at the London
        School of Economics.  'If the coin weere unbiased, the chance of
        getting a result as extreme as that would be less than 7%.'

MacKay asks, "But do these data give evidence that the coin is biased
rather than fair?"
